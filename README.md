# C++ Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the C++ code, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to your Desktop directory:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Desktop
    ```

3. Compile the C++ code using the `g++` compiler with OpenMP support:
    ```bash
    g++ -fopenmp filename.cpp -o filename
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./filename
    ```

Make sure the file `filename.cpp` is located on your Desktop directory.

### Note:
- Replace `filename.cpp` with the actual name of your C++ source file.
